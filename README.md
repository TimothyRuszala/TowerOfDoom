# TowerOfDoom
Based on an "ancient legend", if monks in a temple in India/China/Nepal successfully solve the famous Tower of Hanoi problem with 64 discs, the world will end. Although the puzzle itself wasn't invented until the 19th century, by French mathematician Edouard Lucas, this Java program visualizes a recursive solution to the problem, attempting to end the world along the way. With the 64-disc solution taking no less than a whopping 2^64-1 moves, the world will not be ending any time soon.
