# TowerOfDoom
Based on an "ancient legend", if monks in a temple in India/China/Nepal successfully solve the famous Tower of Hanoi problem with 64 discs, the world will end. 

The puzzle was actually invented in 1883 by French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas, but nonetheless, this Java program visualizes a recursive solution to the problem, attempting to end the world along the way. 

But because the 64-disc solution requires no less than a whopping 2^64-1 moves, the world will not be ending any time soon. :)

# How to run:

Hanoi.java takes two command line arguments, the first being the number of discs to display, and the second being how many milliseconds to spend moving on each disc (minimum value of 1). To visualize the legend, for example, use: 

    java Hanoi 64 1
